### alg_TSP_via_Grover

Project for implementing a solution of the Traveling Sales Person problem, for N cities, using Grover algorithm. This repository contains two python files:
 1. The first contains the classes whose methods are responsible for the construction of the problem
 2. The second file is the algorithm in which i used those methods for selecting Hamiltonian Cycle for a set of N cities.
